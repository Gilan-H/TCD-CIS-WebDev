    <header><h1>All About Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis</h1></header>
	<p>Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest word in the english language;
    originally created in 1935 by the president of the <b>National Puzzlers league.</b> The word 
    is considered an <em>invented word</em> and despite appearing in most dictionaries is 
    technically not a real word and actually just a combination of several latin terms but it is
    still considered the longest word in the enlgish language by most official standards.
  </p>
  <p>It is often refered to as a synonym for silicosis but is actually only a very rare form
    of silicosis caused by inhaling <em>volcanic dust.</em> Silicosis is more specifically a form of
    lung disease caused by inhaling crystaline silica dust marked by inflammation and scarring in the 
    upper lobes of the lungs. Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a type of this 
    disease caused most directly by inhaling volcanic dust. Probably one of the main reasons that 
    Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is not considered a word is because it is a form of
    silicosis which is a form of pneumoconiosis meaning the inclusion of Pneumo in the front half and
    coniosis in the back half of the word are completely unecessary because <em>silico</em> is 
    already present in the word to draw its connnection to the root lung diseases.

  <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a non contagious lung disease
  </li>
  <li>
    The parent disease pneumoconiosis is actually quite common and has had close to half a million cases in recent years
  </li>
  <li>
    Although commonly defined as an extension of pneumoconiosis there is no evidence that it is even a separate or similar disease
  </li>
</ul>
